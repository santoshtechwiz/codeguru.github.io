>Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, Inc. designed and built by Christoph Nakazawa with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js and Svelte.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jest_(JavaScript_framework))

In this post, I will show you an easy way to automatically mock all the function of the module. Jest also alows you to mock module function. By the end of this tutorial, you will learn the following things.

-   How to mock a module functional automatically
-   How to check the function is the mock function
-   How to assert on the mock function

To show the demo I am using the following simple javascript module

```javascript
const utils = {
  getJSON: (data) => JSON.stringify(data),
  isAuthorized: (secret) => secret === "codeguru"
};

module.exports = utils;

```

As you can see the module have two functions  `getJSON`  and  `isAuthorized`  now we are going to write the test for this module.

One way is to load the module and then mock the function manually. But there is a better way to mock the module in  `Jest`. Just add the  `jest.enableAutomock`  on the top of your test file and then load your module as shown in the following code snippet.

```javascript
jest.enableAutomock();
const utils = require("./main");

```

Just by adding  `enableAutomock`  jest will provide the mock version of the function in your test.

```javascript
jest.enableAutomock();

const utils = require("./main");

describe("automatic mocks", () => {
  it("should mock all methods of utils", () => {
    expect(utils.getJSON.mock).toBeTruthy();
      expect(jest.isMockFunction(utils.isAuthorized)).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it("mocked implementation", () => {
    utils.getJSON.mockReturnValue(123);
    expect(utils.getJSON({ name: "test" })).toBe(123);
  });
});

```

As you can see now every function have a  `mock`  property and now you can use all the mock functionality of jest on your function
