In this blog post I will show you shome tips and trics of `Moq` framework. Like how to moq protected method,how to moq async method with some real world example. Before diving into the code let's get familar with some basic terms.

## Why Mocking?

In this blog post I will show you the tips and trics of the Moq framework. For example, how to moq protected method and how to moq async method with real-world examples. Before diving into the code, let's get familiar with some basic terms.

> Moq is commonly used to create mock objects based on interfaces.  
> However, in some cases, Moq allows creating Moq of the classes that are called Partial Moq.

## What is Partial Mock?

> Partial mocking is where you take a class and ask it to behave as usual, except you want to override certain functionality.

## Example

This post will show you how to mock the async protected method in C# using the MOQ framework. The mocking protected method is a little bit tricky, but it’s straightforward.

```csharp

public class ServiceHelper
{
	public async Task<string> GetData(string url)
	{
		var result = await SendRequest(url);
		Console.WriteLine("Doing some real work");
		return result;
	}
	protected virtual async Task<string> SendRequest(string url)
	{
		Console.WriteLine($"Sending Request to {url}");
		var result = await Task.FromResult("From Protected Method");
		return result;
	}
}


```

Let’s write a unit test for the public method.

```csharp
public class ServiceHelperTest
{
	[Fact]
	public async Task Should_call_protected_method()
	{
		var p = new ServiceHelper();
		var data = await p.GetData("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
		Assert.Contains(data,"From Protected Method");
	}
}


```

As you can see, the test is calling the actual protected method.  

Let’s create a mock of the class and set up the behaviour; as you can see in the image below, IntelliSense is not showing the protected method. So let’s run the test without setup and see the result.

```csharp
     [Fact]
	public async Task Should_throw_error_if_call_on_mock_object()
	{
		var mockService = new Mock<ServiceHelper>();
		var data = await mockService.Object.GetData("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
		Assert.Contains(data, "From Protected Method");
	}

```
> You will get the following error

```bash
[FAIL] ServiceHelperTest.Should_throw_error_if_call_on_mock_object: 
Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'value')
```

## How to mock the protected method

. To Mock the protected method, you need to import the following namespace first.

```csharp
using Moq.Protected;

```

```csharp
   [Fact]
	public async Task Should_call_mock_method()
	{
		var mockService = new Mock<ServiceHelper>();
		mockService.Protected().Setup<Task<string>>("SendRequest", ItExpr.IsAny<string>()).ReturnsAsync(() => "From Mock")
			.Verifiable();
		var result = await mockService.Object.GetData("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
		Assert.Contains(result,"From Mock");
		mockService.Verify();
	}


```

If you run the above test case, you can see that it’s calling the Moq method, and the test is pass.

## Limitations

-   > Only drawback with this API is that you will not get the IntelliSense when setup the moq
    
-   > When setting up an  `IProtectedMock`, you should use  `Moq.Protected.ItExpr`  instead of  `Moq. It`.
