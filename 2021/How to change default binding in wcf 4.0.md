In this post, I will share very handy tips for WCF 4.0. As we all know that default binding is a new feature introduced in WCF 4.0. With WCF 4, this is no longer the case because the runtime automatically adds one or more  **“default endpoints”**  for you, thereby making the service usable without any configuration.

```xml
<protocolMapping>
      <add binding="wsHttpBinding" scheme="http"/>
    </protocolMapping>
```
