>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, Linux.

`Node.js` uses the `Google V8` JavaScript engine to execute code, and a large percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript. `Node.js` contains a built-in library to allow applications to act as a Web server without software such as Apache HTTP Server or IIS.  
In this article, I will show you how to create a simple Http Server using node.js Before diving into code, let us first install node.js from the following link.

*If you see similar output then node.js is installed on your machine.*

- Open any text editor and paste following code into it and save it as Sever.js.
```javascript
var http = require("http");

function requestHandler(req, res) {

	res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
	res.write("Hello world");
	//end the response
	res.end();

}
//Create http server
var server = http.createServer(requestHandler);
server.listen(8000, function () {
	console.log("Server is up and running");
})
```
- open command prompt and type following command.
```bash
node Server.js
```
